# Guitar-Hero
Guitar Hero turns a computer keyboard to a music making instrument.
GuitarString is a class that models a vibrating guitar string of a given frequency. The GuitarString object keep tracks of the guitar's ring buffer. The program will implement the ring buffer as a queue using the Queue<E> interface and the LinkedList<E> implementation. 
The Guitar37 class has a total of 37 notes on the chromatic scale from 110Hz to 880Hz.The guitar will be played using the following keys: 
"q2we4r5ty7u8i9op-[=zxdcfvgbnjmk,.;/' "
This use of keyboard characters really imitates a piano keyboard instead of a guitar. Making playing songs a little easier for people used to a piano keyboard.
